This is my repo for deploying my website using GitLabs.
Will eventually be fully coded in HTML, CSS, JS, maybe some JS frameworks? Who knows.

Aug 3rd 7:30 PM: The homepage is started, and features a resume area. Need to add more info, and work on the css properties of the site.

Aug 4th 4:40 PM: Added and put space between buttons. Resume still needs to be worked on.
